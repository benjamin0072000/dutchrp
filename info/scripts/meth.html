    <h3>Meth Lab — Meth Cook Guide</h3>

<p>
The Meth Lab is an advanced and immersive drug production system designed for the Meth Cook job.
It allows players to build and operate a complete meth lab using multiple machines, each with its
own role in the production process. Cooking meth is dangerous and requires attention, planning,
and proper equipment, but successful cooks are rewarded with high profits.
</p>

<p>
Players can choose between multiple drug types, such as Blue Meth or MDMA, each with different
difficulty levels, production times, and effects.
</p>

<h3>Tents (Your Lab Area)</h3>
<p>
Tents create an isolated area where you can safely build your meth lab. They are best used inside
a house, effectively creating a room inside a room.
</p>
<p>
Each tent includes a control panel that allows you to change the interior light color, extinguish
burning objects, and remove the tent when finished. Tents help contain pollution and keep your
operation hidden.
</p>

<img src="meth1.png" alt="Tents Example">

<h3>Pollution System & Ventilation</h3>
<p>
Most meth machines produce pollution during operation. Pollution builds up in specific areas of
the map and becomes more dangerous over time.
</p>
<p>
Higher pollution levels cause stronger visual effects and increased damage. Pollution slowly
evaporates over time, but without proper ventilation it can become deadly.
</p>
<p>
The Ventilation Machine moves pollution away from your lab and releases it at the exhaust pipe
location. Proper ventilation is essential to survive long cooking sessions.
</p>

<h3>Meth Production Machines</h3>

<p>
<strong>Storage:</strong> Allows you to purchase all required chemicals, ingredients, and equipment
needed for meth production. This is your main supply hub before starting a cook.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Furnace (Thorium Furnace):</strong> Used to heat up acid. The temperature must stay in the
green zone. If the acid is too cold it becomes unusable, and if it gets too hot machines may burn
or explode. The longer the temperature remains stable, the higher the final meth quality.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mixer:</strong> Lets you select which drug type you want to produce. Each drug type has
different ingredient requirements, production time, and difficulty, affecting both risk and
reward.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Filter:</strong> Increases the final meth quality. Each successful minigame performed
during filtering improves the overall value of the product.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Filler:</strong> Transfers the finished meth liquid into freezer trays, preparing it for
freezing.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Freezer:</strong> Turns the meth liquid into a solid state. Requires a Liquid Oxygen tank
purchased from Storage. Without freezing, the meth cannot be packed or sold.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Packing Table:</strong> Used to break and pack frozen meth. Holds up to 12 freezer trays
and can be upgraded with an automatic Ice Breaker to speed up the process.
</p>

<h3>Meth Buyer & Drop-Off System</h3>
<p>
Once your meth is ready, interact with the Meth Buyer NPC. Depending on the server settings, you
can either sell directly to the NPC or receive a drop-off location.
</p>
<p>
If assigned a drop-off, you must reach the location within the time limit and deposit the meth
into a hatch in the ground. Failing to deliver in time may result in lost profits.
</p>

<img src="meth5.png" alt="Dropoff Example">

<h3>Meth Effects</h3>
<p>
Meth can be sold for profit or consumed by players. When consumed, it can provide effects such as
increased run speed, damage resistance, or other custom effects. Each drug type has its own visual
effects and music.
</p>

<h3>Risks & Tips</h3>
<p>
Always wear a gas mask before cooking. Use ventilation to control pollution, keep acid temperature
stable, and choose hidden locations. Rushing the process increases the risk of explosions and
total lab failure.
</p>

<h3>Final Notes</h3>
<p>
The Meth Lab system offers high-risk, high-reward gameplay and is one of the most complex criminal
activities on the server. Players who plan carefully and manage their lab correctly can earn large
profits, but one mistake can destroy everything.
